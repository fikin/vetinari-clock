# Lord Vetinari clock

This project is implementing a simple Lord Vetinari clock.

The clock seconds hand is otherwise random moving but minutes and hours are exact.

# Usage

Required are NodeMCU gpio and tmw modules. Virtually all nodemcu builds are featuring them.

Flash the nodemcu sw to ESP.

Install init.lua file.

Enjoy the clock.

# Rewiring exinsting clock

Idea basically is to severe the magnet coil from existing wiring and expose it to 2 nodemcu pins.
